**Senior Computational Scientist**, July 2022 - present

**Computational Scientist**, Oct 2019 - June 2022

- I provide consultation with domain expertise in building/using quantum chemistry codes.
- I prepare/teach workshops on topics such as: building C/C++/Fortran codes, using and building containers, using RAPIDS (NVIDIA), using Spark (Apache), benchmarking parallel programs.
- I maintain the software stack of UVA's HPC cluster using Lmod and EasyBuild.
- I build software containers with a minimalistic approach, without loss of functionality or performance. Most notably, I reduced the size of AlphaFold by 47% and LightGBM by 99%, compared to images built with official Dockerfiles. https://github.com/uvarc/rivanna-docker/
- I write Slack robot plugins and Bash/Python scripts. For example: EasyBuild module installation/uninstallation automation, user information query (LDAP and internal database), custom Jupyter kernel installation for users.
