I am a volunteer pianist at UVA University Hospital (Charlottesville, VA) through the “Music for Healing” program.

I studied music with the following teachers:
- Prof. Keeril Makan, composition, 2011
- Ms. Heng-Jin Park, piano, 2010-11 (Emerson Music Scholarship for piano performance)
- Mr. Chi Wai Sin, theory, 2000-01
- Ms. Li, piano, 1999-2004

Bach is my favorite composer. My composition style is greatly influenced by Bach and a few neoclassical composers.

A subset of my work is freely hosted on [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Sun,_Ruoshi) and [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RuoshiSun). Here are some of the highlights.
