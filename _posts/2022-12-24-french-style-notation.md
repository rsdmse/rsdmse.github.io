András Schiff is my favorite living pianist. However, I disagree with him on two examples regarding Bach's notation in the French style.

## Example 1: Sinfonia from Partita No. 2 in C minor, BWV 826
The first two occurrences of the rhythmic motif at question are marked. This occurs throughout the Grave section. In Schiff's interpretation, however, the 16th rest is (double-)dotted, as he explains in [his lecture on the Bach Partitas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVjBIKNed_Q&t=48m44s).

One cannot decide which is correct (literal versus dotted) from this example alone. Fortunately, we have Bach's corpus at our disposal. Let's take a look at the opening of "Komm, süßes Kreuz" from St. Matthew Passion, BWV 244. The first occurrence of such a rhythmic motif is marked.

Now this by itself does not prove anything, but if we look a few bars ahead, we see that Bach uses both the undotted and dotted rhythms in the bass solo. One must also take into consideration that performers back then read from their parts, not the full score, so they did not know in advance whether the other parts were playing in dotted rhythms or not. Hence, I believe Bach was very precise about whether he intended a note to be dotted or not, and so the first 16th note in the previous figure should be played literally and not as a 32nd (or a 64th if double-dotted).

The same logic would apply to the Partita. One could argue about single- versus double-dotted, but that is a different subject matter.

## Example 2: Gigue from French Suite No. 1 in D minor, BWV 812
This example is especially problematic due to the context of "gigue." One school, including Schiff, argues that gigues are in three or compound time and thus it would be wrong to play this movement literally. I do not claim to be a scholar in this aspect, but I wish to share some of my observations regarding just the rhythmic motif of a dotted 8th followed by three 32nd notes alone, which appear in the subject of the fugue. The 2017 Henle edition even suggests that "playing [the 32nd notes] as triplets is conceivable."

As with the first example, we must examine Bach's corpus for evidence. This rhythmic motif occurs in two preludes from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 2, namely F-sharp major and A-flat major. The former uses the ambiguous dotted notation:

and the latter uses the precise notation:

The precise notation is also used in Contrapunctus VI from the Art of Fugue, BWV 1080:

If one is still not convinced that the two notations are equivalent, Bach's manuscript of the French Overture, BWV 831 should settle all disputes. Here both notations are used. In the second instance, the second 32nd note is aligned with the 16th note in the left hand:

To me, this is very strong evidence that the dotted notation is to be treated exactly as the precise notation and that the former is only a matter of convenience in writing, which should not have been a source of confusion at the time, but nowadays certain scholars may have confused themselves.

In light of such supporting evidence, I believe the same rhythm should be played in the Gigue, which implies the meter is indeed in 2/2 (or 4/4 in certain editions). I am not convinced that Bach would deliberately compose in a wrong meter. In any case, the 32nd notes are definitely not to be played as triplets.
